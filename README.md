# BLENDED LEARNING
# Implementation of Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## AIM:
To implement customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset to group customers based on purchasing habits.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Dataset Loading – Load the customer dataset using pandas and select features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

2.Feature Scaling – Standardize the selected features using StandardScaler to bring them to the same scale.

3.K-Means Clustering – Apply the K-Means algorithm with different numbers of clusters to group similar customers.

4.Elbow Method Visualization – Plot inertia values for different clusters to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Program:

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42, n_init=10) # Explicit n init to suppress warning
    kmeans.fit(X_scaled)
    inertia_values.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.plot(range(1, 11), inertia_values, marker='o', linestyle='-') 
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('Inertia')

## Output:

<Figure size 800x400 with 1 Axes><img width="695" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1519db0b-d697-4cf1-a458-f8f940272b95" />


## Result:
Thus, customer segmentation was successfully implemented using K-Means clustering, grouping customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score.
